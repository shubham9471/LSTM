# LSTM
Performing LSTM on Donor Choose Dataset 
1. Preprocessing  all the Data in DonorsChoose Dataset using train.csv
2. Then Combining 4 essay's into one column named - 'preprocessed_essays'.
3. After step 2 we are training 3 types of models.
4. For all the model we are using 'auc' as a metric.
5. You are free to choose any number of layers/hiddden units but you have to use same type
of architectures shown below.
6. You can use any one of the optimizers and choice of Learning rate and momentum, resource
s: cs231n class notes, cs231n class video.
7. For all the model's, using TensorBoard and ploting the Metric value and Loss with epoch.
8. Use Categorical Cross Entropy as Loss to minimize.
