# LSTM
Performing LSTM on Donor Choose Dataset 

Preprocessing all the Data in DonorsChoose Dataset using train.csv

Then Combining 4 essay's into one column named - 'preprocessed_essays'.

After step 2 we are training 3 types of models.

For all the model we are using 'auc' as a metric.

You are free to choose any number of layers/hiddden units but you have to use same type of architectures shown below.

You can use any one of the optimizers and choice of Learning rate and momentum, resource s: cs231n class notes, cs231n class video.

For all the model's, using TensorBoard and ploting the Metric value and Loss with epoch.

Use Categorical Cross Entropy as Loss to minimize.
